For the array size of 10^4:

NORMAL_MERGESORT_OUTPUT:
real	0m0.016s
user	0m0.012s
sys	0m0.004s

CONCURRENT_MERGESORT_OUTPUT
real	0m0.291s
user	0m0.952s
sys	0m0.101s

THREADED_MERGESORT_OUTPUT
real	0m0.147s
user	0m0.033s
sys	0m0.257s


From the above result we can conclude that the normal merge sort is the fastest followed by the
threaded merge sort and then concurrent_merge_sort.
